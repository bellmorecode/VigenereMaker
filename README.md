# VigenereMaker
 
This is a demo app that allows the user to encrypt and decrypt text-based messages with a Vigienere cipher. 

The Vigenere cipher uses a two-dimension alphabetic key and an accompanying secret work to encode a message.  

This application is an example of how to programmatically implement a encoder / decoder for this method.  

This application also employs some advanced WPF Binding Expressions to allow for a dynamic cypher keys. 

It proves as a useful desktop app if you want to encode / decode messages with your friends or fellow spies.
