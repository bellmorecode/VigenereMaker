# VigenereMaker

## Overview
This is a demo app that you can use to encrypt and decrypt text-based messages with a Vigenere cipher.

## What is a cipher? 
a Cipher is a method of scrambling text to be able to protect the content of the message. 

## What is the Vigenere cipher?
The Vigenere cipher uses a two-dimension alphabetic key and an accompanying secret work to encode a message.  

## Example
Your paraphrase is the private keyword that only your and your associates know.  it is the key to unlock the cipher. 

Encode: 
Message: HELLO WORLD, Paraphrase: HOCKEYPUCK => Output: RTGHS RFTGH

Decode: 
Message: RTGHS RFTGH, Paraphrase: HOCKEYPUCK => Output: HELLO WORLD

## The Code
This application is an example of how to programmatically implement a encoder / decoder for this method.  

## Using WPF and MVVM
This application also employs some advanced WPF Binding Expressions to allow for a dynamic cypher keys. 

## Fun to Use
It proves as a useful desktop app if you want to encode / decode messages with your friends or fellow spies.
