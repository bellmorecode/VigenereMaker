# Vigenere Maker  

Here is a link to try the app: https://gfd.blob.core.windows.net/vig/VigenereMakerApp.application

It is not signed properly, so you may see some security warnings.

You can alternatively download and compile the app with the .NET Framework.  This version is compiled with version 4.8, but the implementation should support as far back as 4.5
